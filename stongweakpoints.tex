\section{Strong and weak points about Neural Networks applications for Monte Carlo simulations}
\section{Speed, accuracy and reliability}
\label{subsec:speed}
As described in Section~\ref{subsec:interactions}, one of the main advantage of AI inspired systems, when compared to more standard simulation algorithms, is a potential speed-up without necessarily impacting performance.
The improvement comes from the nature of feed-forwards Neural Networks used at inference time, which are described as a series of matrix multiplication of fixed length\footnote{This is strictly not valid for some types of recurrent networks, where the recurrency can introduce an indetermination in the sequence of mathematical operations.}, without access to any data structure apart from the inputs and the weights. Today's processors, from CPUs to GPUs to TPUs, are very efficient in processing matrix algebra calclations; this reflects diretly to short processing times.
In order to give quantitative examples, we can refer to the two complex GANs described in Section~\ref{subsec:interactions}, which are fed by Geant4-processed events in the training phase.
Table~\ref{tab:speed} reports on the absolute time needed to process Geant4 vs the GAN for events with similar input; the speedups are of order 100x using CPUs, and an additional factor 100x with GPUs\footnote{It can be said that it is an unfair comparison since Geant4 cannot currently use GPUs; still, it shows how AI inspired tools offer a path to the use of more performant technologies.}.

AI inspired tools are a mathematical solution to problems we have problems solving algorithmically, either because too difficult or too slow.
