abstract = {We investigated the classification of regions of interest (ROI's) on mammograms as either mass or normal tissue using a convolution neural network (CNN). A CNN is a backpropagation neural network with two-dimensional (2-D) weight kernels that operate on images. A generalized, fast and stable implementation of the CNN was developed. The input images to the CNN were obtained from the ROI's using two techniques. The first technique employed averaging and subsampling. The second technique employed texture feature extraction methods applied to small subregions inside the ROI. Features computed over different subregions were arranged as texture images, which were subsequently used as CNN inputs. The effects of CNN architecture and texture feature parameters on classification accuracy were studied. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methodology was used to evaluate the classification accuracy. A data set consisting of 168 ROI's containing biopsy-proven masses and 504 ROI's containing normal breast tissue was extracted from 168 mammograms by radiologists experienced in mammography. This data set was used for training and testing the CNN. With the best combination of CNN architecture and texture feature parameters, the area under the test ROC curve reached 0.87, which corresponded to a true-positive fraction of 90% at a false positive fraction of 31%. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using a CNN for classification of masses and normal tissue on mammograms. {\textcopyright} 1996 IEEE.},

@article{Ben-Bassat1980,
abstract = {The sensitivity of Bayesian pattern recognition models to multiplicative deviations in the prior and conditional probabilities is investigated for the two-class case. Explicit formulas are obtained for the factor K by which the computed posterior probabilities should be divided in order to eliminate the deviation effect. Numerical results for the case of binary features indicate that the Bayesian model tolerates large deviations in the prior and conditional probabilities. In fact, the a priori ratio and the likelihood ratio may deviate within a range of 65-135 percent and still produce posterior probabilities in accurate proximity of at most Â±0.10.The main implication is that Bayesian systems which are based on limited data or subjective probabilities are expected to have a high percentage of correct classification despite the fact that the prior and conditional probabilities they use may deviate rather significantly from the true values.

The aim is to extract information in an affective and efficient manner for improved clinical diagnosis. The recent advances in the field of biomedical engineering have made medical image analysis one of the top research and development area. One of the reasons for this advancement is the application of machine learning techniques for the analysis of medical images. Deep learning is successfully used as a tool for machine learning, where a neural network is capable of automatically learning features. This is in contrast to those methods where traditionally hand crafted features are used. The selection and calculation of these features is a challenging task. Among deep learning techniques, deep convolutional networks are actively used for the purpose of medical image analysis. This includes application areas such as segmentation, abnormality detection, disease classification, computer aided diagnosis and retrieval. In this study, a comprehensive review of the current state-of-the-art in medical image analysis using deep convolutional networks is presented. The challenges and potential of these techniques are also highlighted.},

abstract = {Scientific simulations on high-performance computing (HPC) systems can generate large amounts of floating-point data per run. As compared to lossless compressors, lossy compressors, such as SZ and ZFP, can reduce data volume more aggressively while maintaining the usefulness of the data. However, a reduction ratio of more than two orders of magnitude is almost impossible without seriously distorting the data. In deep learning, the autoencoder has shown potential for data compression. Whether the autoencoder can deliver similar performance on scientific data, however, is unknown. In this paper, we for the first time conduct a comprehensive study on the use of autoencoders to compress real-world scientific data and illustrate several key findings on using autoencoders for scientific data reduction. We implement an autoencoder-based compression prototype to reduce floating-point data. Our study shows that the out-of-the-box implementation needs to be further tuned in order to achieve high compression ratios and satisfactory error bounds. Our evaluation results show that, for most test datasets, the tuned autoencoder outperforms SZ by 2 to 4X, and ZFP by 10 to 50X in compression ratios, respectively. Our practices and lessons learned in this work can direct future optimizations for using autoencoders to compress scientific data.},

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

We apply these neural networks to the modeling of electromagnetic showers in a longitudinally segmented calorimeter and achieve speedup factors comparable to or better than existing full simulation techniques on CPU (100Ã-1000Ã) and even faster on GPU (up to â¼10 5 Ã). There are still challenges for achieving precision across the entire phase space, but our solution can reproduce a variety of geometric shower shape properties of photons, positrons, and charged pions.

In the simulation, particle tracking inside the SPECT head is replaced by a plane. Photons are stopped at the plane and the energy and direction are used as input to the ANN, which provides detection probabilities in each energy window.

@article{Ju2020,
abstract = {Jet clustering is traditionally an unsupervised learning task because there is no unique way to associate hadronic final states with the quark and gluon degrees of freedom that generated them. However, for uncolored particles like W, Z, and Higgs bosons, it is possible to approximately (though not exactly) associate final state hadrons to their ancestor. By labeling simulated final state hadrons as descending from an uncolored particle, it is possible to train a supervised learning method to create boson jets. Such a method would operate on individual particles and identify connections between particles originating from the same uncolored particle. Graph neural networks are well-suited for this purpose as they can act on unordered sets and naturally create strong connections between particles with the same label. These networks are used to train a supervised jet clustering algorithm. The kinematic properties of these graph jets better match the properties of simulated Lorentz-boosted W bosons. Furthermore, the graph jets contain more information for discriminating W jets from generic quark jets. This work marks the beginning of a new exploration in jet physics to use machine learning to optimize the construction of jets and not only the observables computed from jet constituents.},

abstract = {Pattern recognition problems in high energy physics are notably different from traditional machine learning applications in computer vision. Reconstruction algorithms identify and measure the kinematic properties of particles produced in high energy collisions and recorded with complex detector systems. Two critical applications are the reconstruction of charged particle trajectories in tracking detectors and the reconstruction of particle showers in calorimeters. These two problems have unique challenges and characteristics, but both have high dimensionality, high degree of sparsity, and complex geometric layouts. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a relatively new class of deep learning architectures which can deal with such data effectively, allowing scientists to incorporate domain knowledge in a graph structure and learn powerful representations leveraging that structure to identify patterns of interest. In this work we demonstrate the applicability of GNNs to these two diverse particle reconstruction problems.},

The present work proves the success of using three dimensional convolutional GAN. Energy showers are well reproduced in all dimensions and show a good agreement with standard techniques (Geant4 detailed simulation).

@article{Arce2021,
abstract = {Background: Geant4 is a Monte Carlo code extensively used in medical physics for a wide range of applications, such as dosimetry, micro- and nanodosimetry, imaging, radiation protection, and nuclear medicine. Geant4 is continuously evolving, so it is crucial to have a system that benchmarks this Monte Carlo code for medical physics against reference data and to perform regression testing. Aims: To respond to these needs, we developed G4-Med, a benchmarking and regression testing system of Geant4 for medical physics. Materials and Methods: G4-Med currently includes 18 tests. They range from the benchmarking of fundamental physics quantities to the testing of Monte Carlo simulation setups typical of medical physics applications. Both electromagnetic and hadronic physics processes and models within the prebuilt Geant4 physics lists are tested. The tests included in G4-Med are executed on the CERN computing infrastructure via the use of the geant-val web application, developed at CERN for Geant4 testing. The physical observables can be compared to reference data for benchmarking and to results of previous Geant4 versions for regression testing purposes. Results: This paper describes the tests included in G4-Med and shows the results derived from the benchmarking of Geant4 10.5 against reference data. Discussion: Our results indicate that the Geant4 electromagnetic physics constructor G4EmStandardPhysics_option4 gives a good agreement with the reference data for all the tests. The QGSP_BIC_HP physics list provided an overall adequate description of the physics involved in hadron therapy, including proton and carbon ion therapy. New tests should be included in the next stage of the project to extend the benchmarking to other physical quantities and application scenarios of interest for medical physics. Conclusion: The results presented and discussed in this paper will aid users in tailoring physics lists to their particular application.},

@article{Mancini-Terracciano2019,
abstract = {Purpose: Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are widely used for medical applications and nuclear reaction models are fundamental for the simulation of the particle interactions with patients in ion therapy. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to have reliable models in MC simulations for such interactions. Geant4 is one of the most used toolkits for MC simulation. However, its models showed severe limitations in reproducing the yields measured in the interaction of ion beams below 100 MeV/u with thin targets. For this reason, we interfaced two models, SMF (âStochastic Mean Fieldâ) and BLOB (âBoltzmann-Langevin One Bodyâ), dedicated to simulate such reactions, with Geant4. Methods: Both SMF and BLOB are semi-classical, one-body approaches to solve the Boltzmann-Langevin equation. They include an identical treatment of the mean-field propagation, on the basis of the same effective interaction, but they differ in the way fluctuations are included. Furthermore, we tested a correction to the excitation energy calculated for the light fragments emerging from the simulations and a simple coalescence model. Results: While both SMF and BLOB have been developed to simulate heavy ion interactions, they show very good results in reproducing the experimental yields of light fragments, up to alpha particles, obtained in the interaction of 12C with a thin carbon target at 62 MeV/u. Conclusions: BLOB in particular gives promising results and this stresses the importance of integrating it into the Geant4 toolkit.},

@article{Ciardiello2020,
abstract = {Purpose: A reliable model to simulate nuclear interactions is fundamental for Ion-therapy. We already showed how BLOB (âBoltzmann-Langevin One Bodyâ), a model developed to simulate heavy ion interactions up to few hundreds of MeV/u, could simulate also 12C reactions in the same energy domain. However, its computation time is too long for any medical application. For this reason we present the possibility of emulating it with a Deep Learning algorithm. Methods: The BLOB final state is a Probability Density Function (PDF) of finding a nucleon in a position of the phase space. We discretised this PDF and trained a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) to reproduce such a discrete PDF. As a proof of concept, we developed and trained a VAE to emulate BLOB in simulating the interactions of 12C with 12C at 62 MeV/u. To have more control on the generation, we forced the VAE latent space to be organised with respect to the impact parameter (b) training a classifier of b jointly with the VAE. Results: The distributions obtained from the VAE are similar to the input ones and the computation time needed to use the VAE as a generator is negligible. Conclusions: We show that it is possible to use a Deep Learning approach to emulate a model developed to simulate nuclear reactions in the energy range of interest for Ion-therapy. We foresee the implementation of the generation part in C++ and to interface it with the most used Monte Carlo toolkit: Geant4.},

Our frameworkâwhich we term âGraph Network-based Simulatorsâ (GNS)ârepresents the state of a physical system with particles, expressed as nodes in a graph, and computes dynamics via learned message-passing. Our results show that our model can generalize from single-timestep predictions with thousands of particles during training, to different initial conditions, thousands of timesteps, and at least an order of magnitude more particles at test time. Our model was robust to hyperparameter choices across various evaluation metrics: the main determinants of long-term performance were the number of message-passing steps, and mitigating the accumulation of error by corrupting the training data with noise. Our GNS framework is the most accurate general-purpose learned physics simulator to date, and holds promise for solving a wide range of complex forward and inverse problems.},

@article{Linardatos2021,
abstract = {Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to its widespread industrial adoption, with machine learning systems demonstrating superhuman performance in a significant number of tasks. However, this surge in performance, has often been achieved through increased model complexity, turning such systems into âblack boxâ approaches and causing uncertainty regarding the way they operate and, ultimately, the way that they come to decisions. This ambiguity has made it problematic for machine learning systems to be adopted in sensitive yet critical domains, where their value could be immense, such as healthcare. As a result, scientific interest in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), a field that is concerned with the development of new methods that explain and interpret machine learning models, has been tremendously reignited over recent years. This study focuses on machine learning interpretability methods; more specifically, a literature review and taxonomy of these methods are presented, as well as links to their programming implementations, in the hope that this survey would serve as a reference point for both theorists and practitioners.},

Such constraints are usually imposed as soft constraints by adding new terms to the loss function that is minimized during training. An alternative is to impose them as hard constraints, which has a number of theoretical benefits but has not been explored so far due to the perceived intractability of the problem. In this paper, we show that imposing hard constraints can in fact be done in a computationally feasible way and delivers reasonable results. However, the theoretical benefits do not materialize and the resulting technique is no better than existing ones relying on soft constraints. We analyze the reasons for this and hope to spur other researchers into proposing better solutions.},
